# N741 - rattle demo

1. You should be able to install the `rattle` package like any other package (go to tools/install packages and select rattle) from the CRAN repository. Learn more about `rattle` at [https://rattle.togaware.com/](https://rattle.togaware.com/) - especially see the installation instructions for Windows and Mac operating systems (relative to the `RGtk2` package dependency).

2. After installing `rattle`, run `library(rattle)`, and then run `rattle()`.

3. See [rattle_script_demo.R](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N741_rattle_demo/blob/main/rattle_script_demo.R) to get started.
